My name is Abigail Garner, this is my SBA for Lesson 316. I used html, javascript and css to create this webpage. Within the HTML document I created forms and added attributes within the elements so that it would both affect user interaction and the BOM. I manipulated the DOM with Javascript by creating elements, validating the forms I made and both DOM and BOM properties and methods to prompt messages to the user to how to correctly input data. I selected elements by methods such as selectElementByID and others. Additionally, I affected the CSS through javascript by using style property and adding colors and changing sizes of the text.
